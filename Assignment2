			With the continuous development of Internet technology and the popularity of smart products, Cyber Security has increasingly become the focus of attention.Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.
			<p>When we use smart products, we are often subject to different types of security threats, whether stealing customer account records or clicking on a <strong>phishing link, suspicious activity by employees,Vendors and suppliers</strong> (or malware that learns to imitate insider behavior while quietly exfiltrating data may cause property damage or privacy leakage. Therefore, software that comes with smart product systems, software developed by third-party companies, and a large amount of network security education have become popular. , related discussions often occur on Twitter.

	 <p>Obviously, SimonesRandy is also a robot, and all his retweets are interactions with the first robot L&A. In addition, his twitter only shows pictures of sexy women posted by users he followed.</P>

	 <h4>(c) The top retweet analysis and the ratio of tweets to retweets</h4>
   <p> After my analysis of the "top10 twitters and retwitters", I found that the most influential twitter came from an article published by moneycontrolcm on Jan9. moneycontrolcm is a twitter that provides unique analysis for markets, companies and the economy. This article is a preview of an interview with Ather founder Tarun, which will focus on the battle for market share in the electric vehicle space and the industry's response to #Budget2023 expect.Even though it was only retweeted 10 times and only had 63 likes. But this tweet has 10.1k views. </P>
	 <p>I got a total of 3823 tweets, of which 1911 retweets, the ratio is around 50%.</p>

   <h4>(d) The ratio of tweet/retweets came from the top 10 tweeters</h4>
	 <P>Top10 Twitters released a total of 494 tweets, of which 211 retweets, retweets/tweets is 42.7%.</P>

   <h4>(e) Sentiment analysis</h4>
	 <p>I analyzed tweets and retweets from top10 twitters that are more representative of the Cyber Security hashtag. Before sorting out these tweets and retweets, I did some data screening and cleaned up some daily usage. To my surprise, apart from the predictable words like "security" and "hacker", companies related to new energy such as "Cenn" and "Tesla" also often appear under the hashtags. At the same time, #EV and #CENN is often seen alongside #Cyber Security.</p>

		<h2 id="section3" style="color:green;">Conclusion</h2>
		<p>While analyzing this dataset, I found many interesting insights related to the geographical properties of Twitter users and the development of Cyber Security. Through the analysis, it is not difficult to see that there are many well-known Internet celebrities or the media  on Twitter continue to pay attention to topics related to Cyber Security. At the same time, hashtags such as #EV #Tesla #Intelligence are usually discussed together with #Cyber Security, from which we can roughly draw a conclusion that cybersecurity is valued in the field of new energy vehicles and industrial intelligence. From another perspective, maybe Cyber Security is an important condition for autonomous driving, which is similar to what I learned in the book "Automobile".

    <p>The data of my data set comes from Twitters released from 08Jan-11Jan. From the perspective of Demographic, these Twitters mainly come from industrially developed countries such as India, England, and Canada, and the number of tweets reached its peak in 09Jan.Similar to the database as a whole, "EV" and "Tesla" were the focus of discussion. This method can be applied to study the changes in the industry and the focus of the discussion.
